    <h2>We are the best at bringing food home</h2>
    <article>
        <p>We aim to provide each and every household in 12 markets with the opportunity to enjoy wholesome, home-made meals with no preparing, no shopping and no hassle.

            Everything required for delicious meals every day is carefully planned, carefully sourced and delivered to the front door of each subscriber at the time most convenient for them.

            Behind the scenes, a huge data-driven technology platform puts us in prime position to leverage subscriber touch points. This allows us to consistently manage supply chains and demand, and to optimize the customer experience as well as our business economics.

            Our subscription business model with regular delivery enables us to fundamentally change the way consumers shop for food and to develop new ways people prepare and consume meals, changing the traditional food supply chain.</p>
